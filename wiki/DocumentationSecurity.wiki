<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

== Register Globals ==

register_globals is turned off in the `.htaccess` file.

== Error Reporting ==

If debugging is turned off (with setting the configuration variable `$debug` to {{{false}}} in a production environment), errors and exceptions are never shown in the front-end. Instead, they are logged to `private/var/log` (make sure this directory is writable, otherwise Ajde will error out horrendously).

== Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ==

== Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention ==

== Exposing Sensitive Information ==
